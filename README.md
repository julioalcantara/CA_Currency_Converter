Assignment Introduction
You have been assigned to develop a simple mobile application using Phonegap to convert a given amount of American dollars to another currency of your choice (not the user’s) using a real time conversion rate from an external API. 

Specific Requirements 
• Users should be allowed to type in the amount of money they would like to convert. 
• Conversions should be done in both directions (from American dollars to another currency and from another currency to American dollars). You can choose what the other currency will be. 
• The conversion rate should be requested from the external API every time a conversion is going to be performed. 
• As it is a mobile application, you must provide the binary code to install the application in Android (.apk file), built using https://build.phonegap.com/apps  
• You are allowed to use any currency conversion API such as https://currencylayer.com/ . Don’t limit yourself, if you know any other API, you are free to use it.
